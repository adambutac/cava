# cava

C.A.V.A is an open source sound visualization program written in C.

The code is terrible, but I found the concept interesting and put my own spin on things.
I now use this as a transparent overlay for my desktop wallpaper.

The original project can be found <a href="https://github.com/karlstav/cava">here</a>.

I omitted much of the project, placing in here only the files I have touched.
